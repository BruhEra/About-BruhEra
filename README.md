# About-BruhEra 
So basically I'm just a little kid who loves making montage, I think you won't beleive me you can see my live streams there you can see my beautifull face.
I wanted to talk about "How it all started". So my brother "Live Ekansh" started a channel.
His videos were very impressive.So I tried to find a good editor but sadly all the editing softwares were asking me to buy them ;_;
I make montage on a bad editor but in the future, I would try to edit on a good editor.
I feel sad when I don't get a response on a video, actully the problem is that videos don't get the reach to the people (Plz wish me luck I have sad life).
Right now I have 8 subscriber, Whenever someone likes my video or comments I really feel motivated, I don't beg you for sub, I Just
say view my video once so don't think I'm that person who says "Guys plz sub and like my video" in the starting of the video.
I upload videos monthly but for few days I'm uploding continuously. I can't upload because of Studies, Whenever I get time I edit videos and upload.
So that's it.
Here are the questions answer's you may ask me.
Que. What's your name?
Ans. My name is Aarav.
Que. You are a "nub" kiddo!
Ans. You are not "Zomballr" either!
Que. How do you edit even though you have such a small age?
Ans. Bro age is just a number.
